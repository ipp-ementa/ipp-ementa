# ipp-ementa üçï

ipp-ementa aims to ease the access of [IPP](https://www.ipp.pt/) schools canteen menus.

## The problem
Currently IPP offers a service for acessing canteen menus ([GiCANT](https://portal.ipp.pt/GICANT/Info_GiCANT.aspx)), but it's very limited as only IPP schools students and professors/employees can access it, as well as it's only available in various daily moments

## How does ipp-ementa come in handy? 
ipp-ementa offers a delightful cross-platform mobile application which users can use it to view canteen menus without having to authenticate in GiCANT, at any time of the day.

All menus data can be consumed via a REST API, available to everyone with no rate limit
